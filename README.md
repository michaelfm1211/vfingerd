# vfingerd
vfingerd is a a virtual finger server configured with config files, rather
than reading your /etc/passwd (unless configured to do so!). Users can
customize their finger output by having vfingerd serve their
[plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)) file. By default
vfingerd only tries to show your username, real name, and your plan file.
